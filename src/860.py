# Gary moves (and vice versa for Sally):
# 1. remove 1 coin from GG; 2. remove 2 coins from GG
# 3. remove 2 coins from GS; 4. remove 1 coin from G
# It's always better for Gary to remove 1 coin from GG rather than both,
# since it gives him an extra move. So Gary's moves remove 1 gold coin.
# The priority is:
# 1. remove GS, since it decreases silver
# 2. remove SG, since if not next turn Sally could decrease gold
# 3. remove one gold from G or GG

# From the given examples, GG SS and SG GS are fair combos.
# But this gives (2n choose n)^2 (A002894), 63504 = F(10) - 90
# After thinking for a while, I found the fair example GS GS GS GS SS
# Gary start  -> GS GS GS SS   -> G GS GS SS -> G GS SS   -> G G SS -> fair
# Sally start -> G GS GS GS SS -> G GS GS SS -> G G GS SS -> G G SS -> fair
# (the fair "unit" is actually 5 coins: GS GS S)
# because n is even, the fair combo is double: 8xGS 2xSS.

# Then I assumed these were the only fair combos. I think the two combos
# cover all optimal move and response actions.
# 8xGS 2xSS and 8xSG 2xGG are actually pairs of GG SS and SG GS, so
# "cancel out". Therefore the cases are:
# 1. j SS, j GG, k GS, k SG
# 2. j+2i SS, j GG, k+8i GS, k SG
# 3. j SS, j+2i GG, k GS, k+8i SG
# These can be combined into one case, count twice if i>0.
